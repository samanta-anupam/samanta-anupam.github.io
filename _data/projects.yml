  description: #"A few projects and research projects that I have worked upon in these years"
- project:
  title: PROMPT
  link: "http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7823676/"
  tagline: "A Tag recommendation system for the 100M Flickr Dataset(YFCC100M) leveraging personal and social contexts and multimodal analysis on images to recommend tags. Performed user-profile clustering, asymmetric tag co-occurrence probabilities of tags, neighbor voting, and random walk to recommend top 5 tags. Published in IEEE (DOI:10.1109/ISM.2016.0109)."
- project:
  title: Design-as-embeddings and their application for improving naively generated advertisement designs.
  link: "#"
  tagline: "Design-as-embeddings for deep learned based design improvements (Ongoing). Currently working on a project on using deep learning models to improve naively generated designs. We train a variational autoencoder on dataset of design blueprints with each category as a channel that can improve any naively generated design based on essential design aesthetics learned from the dataset.
- project:
  title: HTML Ads Scraper
  link: "https://github.com/samanta-anupam/Ads_scraper"
  tagline: "A online ads scraper project to extract ads from webpages for creating a dataset of online ads. The aim of the dataset is to collect static html to capture design cues from any online ad campaign. (Selenium web driver, PhantomJS, Python)"
- project:
  title: Satellite Image Analysis for Water Crisis
  link: "https://github.com/samanta-anupam/similar-water-regions"
  tagline: "Find similar regions in world based on the trends of lost or new areas of permanent water sources using satellite water dataset analysis. This could be used to predict water quality, consumption and depletion patterns of other countries by extrapolating data from United States water bodies (USGS Dataset). (Spark, Python, LSH)"
- project:
  title: Pheno-predictor
  link: "https://github.com/samanta-anupam/pheno-predictor"
  tagline: "Classify phenotypes from 0.2 million Transcriptomic Features and 1.2 million Equivalence Classes output from Salmon (a genome mapping and quantification tool) using dimensionality reduction, Artificial Neural Networks and XGBoost. (Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Python, XGBoost)"
- project:
  title: Koupe
  #link: "#"
  tagline: "A Ride Sharing Android Application. Worked on a startup to develop a car pooling app using Google Maps APIâ€™s and novel ride matching algorithm, to map riders and drivers heading in same direction. (Android)"
