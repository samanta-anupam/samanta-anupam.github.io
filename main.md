# My Github Blog
Hi, I am Anupam Samanta. I am a current CS Grad student in Stony Brook University. I am here to blog about whatever I learn new. Hope you find them useful! Contact me on [email](mailto:samanta.anupam.19@gmail.com)

### Big Data Analytics:  
These blog posts are related to the assignments and our final project in pyspark during the class of Big Data Analytics(CSE545), Stony Brook University:  

1. [Blog Corpus Industry Mention count using Spark]():  
A spark implementation to count the number of times industries have been mentioned in the blog corpus dataset. [Dataset](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm)

2. [Satellite Image Analysis]():
Find similar regions in satellite images by implementing singular value decomposition and locality sensitive hashing from scratch. [Dataset](https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/high_res_ortho)

3. [Similar Water Regions](): Find coordinates of areas in the entire world that are similar to each other in surface water trends using the Surface water Satellite dataset. [Dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download)
  
### Computer Vision:
These blog posts are related about the computer vision assignments in OpenCV and Tensorflow that we had in the class of Introduction to Computer Vision (CSE527) by Prof. Roy Shilkrot, Stony Brook University.  

1. [Laplacian Blending, Histogram Equalization and Convolution]()
2. [Image Alignment, Panoramas]()
3. [Detection and Tracking]()
4. [Segmentation]()
5. [Structured Light]()
6. [MNIST CNN Classifier and Transfer Learning]()

### Deep Learning by Udacity Assignments:
These blogs are on the assignments of the Udacity course (UD730).

1. [Assignment 1]()
2. [Assignment 2]()
3. [Assignment 3]()
4. [Assignment 4]()
5. [Assignment 5]()

### Autoencoders and design simulation
1. [HTML Ads Scraper]()
2. [Similarity search of advertisement design using autoencoders]()

### Phenotype Predictor using machine learning
[Pheno-Predictor](): A machine learning approach to classify phenotype of individual human beings based on their RNA sequences and equivalence classes as features. We used various approaches for dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms for this task. We were able to acheive an accuracy of 91.9% on 3 fold validation using our best method.
