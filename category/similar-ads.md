# Ad generation using deep learning.  

These blogs keeps track with my project on advertisement generation using deep learning methods. Till now, I have tried to gather a dataset of online html advertisements. After gathering a rather small dataset, I moved to a more traditional dataset based on the image ads from all possible sources, including, magazine, television, newspaper and even online ads.  

Then we used it to find similar ads for given query ads using variational autoencoders, as a first step to begin with our final aim of generation of such ads.
